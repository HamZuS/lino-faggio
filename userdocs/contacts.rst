Faggio-specific notes about the contacts module
-----------------------------------------------

:ddref:`courses.Pupil` and :ddref:`courses.Teacher`
are subclasses of 
:ddref:`contacts.Person`.
This means that any given  :ddref:`contacts.Person`
can be *also* a
:ddref:`courses.Pupil`
or
:ddref:`courses.Teacher`
(or both).
